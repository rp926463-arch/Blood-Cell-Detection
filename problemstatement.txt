We will be working on a healthcare related dataset and the aim here is to solve a Blood Cell Detection problem. 
Our task is to detect all the Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), and Platelets in each image taken via 
microscopic image readings. Below is a sample of what our final predictions should look like:



The reason for choosing this dataset is that the density of RBCs, WBCs and Platelets in our blood stream provides a 
lot of information about the immune system and hemoglobin. This can help us potentially identify whether a person is 
healthy or not, and if any discrepancy is found in their blood, actions can be taken quickly to diagnose that.

Manually looking at the sample via a microscope is a tedious process. And this is where Deep Learning models play such a vital role. They can classify and detect the blood cells from microscopic images with impressive precision.

The full blood cell detection dataset for our challenge can be downloaded from here. I have modified the data a tiny bit for the scope of this article:

The bounding boxes have been converted from the given .xml format to a .csv format
I have also created the training and test set split on the entire dataset by randomly picking images for the split
Note that we will be using the popular Keras framework with a TensorFlow backend in Python to train and build our model.
